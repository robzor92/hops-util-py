"""
Experiment module used for running Experiments, Parallel Experiments and Distributed Training on Hopsworks.

The programming model is that you wrap the code to run inside a wrapper function.
Inside that wrapper function provide all imports and parts that make up your experiment, see examples below.
Whenever a function to run an experiment is invoked it is also registered in the Experiments service along with the provided information.

*Three different types of experiments*
    - Run a single standalone Experiment using the *launch* function.
    - Run Parallel Experiments performing hyperparameter optimization using *grid_search* or *differential_evolution*.
    - Run single or multi-machine Distributed Training using *parameter_server* or *collective_all_reduce*.
